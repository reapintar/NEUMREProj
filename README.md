## Instructions

The Jupyter notebook can be run in Kaggle's framework for editing the notebook, and in the submitted notebook the data is pulled directly from Kaggle's repository. If one would want to run the notebook locally, first they would have to download the datasets (https://dcase.community/challenge2023/task-first-shot-unsupervised-anomalous-sound-detection-for-machine-condition-monitoring) and place them in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook CNNAutoencoder.ipynb, pytorch_common.py and common.py and make sure they are working with Python version 3.7.6 (compatibility of PyTorch and the libraries used in this project can't be guaranteed if the user is using a newer version of Python). Additionally, if the user has the appropriate version of Python, they would only need to change the Paths to the folders containing datasets in the notebooks code.
